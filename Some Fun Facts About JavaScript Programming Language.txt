Some Fun Facts I know About the JavaScript Programming Language.

•	JavaScript took just 10 days to develop.
•	JavaScript was invented in 1995 by Brendan Eich for use with the Netscape 2 browser. The original name for JavaScript was Mocha. 
•	JavaScript was probably named after Java.
•	JavaScript is about as similar to Java as a hamburger is similar to ham. But there used to be support for running Java in the browser by way of Java “applets”. 
This technology is now completely deprecated, but at the time, it likely made more sense to piggy-back off the popularity of Java for the sake of widespread adoption.
•	GitHub says JavaScript is the Most Popular language in the world.
•	According to https://octoverse.github.com/, JavaScript has been the most widely used language across GitHub repositories since 2014, when this statistic was first tracked. Here’s a few reasons why that may be:
•	JavaScript is the de facto standard for building websites, and websites are essential for virtually any organization.
•	JavaScript is commonly taught and fairly easy to learn, making it popular among developers.
•	The heavily client-side nature of the language makes JavaScript repositories likelier to be open-source, potentially skewing the rankings away from large, private, enterprise-style projects.
•	JavaScript is responsible for Web2, precursor to Web3.
